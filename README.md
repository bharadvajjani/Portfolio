> Systems-focused Software & Web Engineer  
> Adelaide, South Australia  

I build and support modern web + cloud systems that stay reliable in real environments.

From LAMP and WordPress builds to Azure identity and production-ready workflows, I work at the intersection of engineering, systems, and design.

## ⚡ What I Actually Do

- Build structured web applications (PHP, JavaScript, REST APIs)
- Deliver CMS-driven platforms (WordPress, integrations, e-commerce)
- Support cloud + identity systems (Azure, Azure AD, MFA, M365)
- Work close to production (incident thinking, documentation, reliability)
- Design clean UI systems (Figma-informed, conversion-aware layouts)

I care about systems that behave well — not just code that runs.
